# Cosmo-droidian

This is the initial commit of files to get droidian running on Planet Cosmo

Just dumping the files that have been used to get droidian running on cosmo. I intend on creating a droidian adaptation package file in the future time permitting (and learning how halium works).

At the moment the following works:
1. screen
2. touchscreen 
3. keyboard (has to be selected during initial setup)
4. camera (front and back)
5. sms (sending and receiving)
6. sound (no control of volume)
7. screen rotation
8. Screen scaling

What isn't worknig
1. Screen blanking when lid is closed
2. Bluetooth
3. mobile data
